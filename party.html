<h4 id="defense-101">Defense 101</h4>

<p><strong> What is a defense? </strong> </p>
<p>I am in a PhD program in Computational & Applied Mathematics at UChicago, where I have been doing research. In order to actually receive a PhD, I have to "defend" my research to a committee of professors. The defense will be a ~45 min scientific talk open to the public followed by a closed door committee meeting. You are welcome to attend the public talk. </p>

<p><strong> What kind of research do you do again? </strong> </p>
<p> I work on developing and implementing computational algorithms for modeling materials at the level of individual electrons and nuclei. The goal of my research is to make computational simulations of materials with applications in low energy electronics and quantum computers less expensive and more accurate. </strong> </p>

<p><strong> Will I understand the talk if I don't have a PhD in quantum physics? </strong> </p>
<p> Probably not. It is a talk that is open to the general public but not aimed at the general public. That being said, I would love for you to come if you are interested! And there will be pastries and coffee. </p>

<p><strong> I am actually interested in your research and want to learn more before coming to the defense. Where can I learn more? </strong> </p>
<p> Look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rAFmacAAAAAJ"> google scholar</a> and sort by "year". My defense will cover the recent works (2025+).</p>

<p><strong> Is it rude to come to the party and not the defense? I have to work/it is inconvenient for me to come to Hyde Park during the day/I think the defense will be boring. </strong> </p>
<p> Not at all! I will in no way be offended if you would just like to come to the party. I am so fortunate to have had a great experience in graduate school, and I am excited to celebrate with my friends, family, and colleagues. In terms of RSVP, it is much more important to decide whether you'd like to come to the party at night than if you'd like to show up to the defense during the day. </p>

<p><strong>What if you fail the defense?</strong></p>
<p>That would be sad and embarrassing but I will still have a party anyway. </p>

<h4 id="defense-logistics">Defense logistics</h4>

<p><strong>How should I get to Hyde Park? </strong></p>
<p>You can take the 6 bus from the loop, the Metra electric line to 55-56-57th street, drive, or Uber. There is street parking (paid and unpaid) on UChicago's campus. I would not recommend parking in the UChicago parking garages because it is expensive and you should be able to find street parking with sufficient persistence. If you are truly struggling to find parking, there are always open spots on Kimbark in between 55th & 56th streets. </p>

<p><strong>Where will the defense be?</strong></p>
<p>I will update the location for the defense and post any relevant instructions for how to get there once the room for the defense has been assigned.</p>

<p><strong>How early should I get there?</strong></p>
<p>5-10 minutes before 2pm should suffice. </p>

<p><strong>What should I wear?</strong></p>
<p>This is a casual event. Wear whatever you want. Sometimes the air conditioning is really strong, and sometimes the rooms are too hot, so make of that what you will.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be food?</strong></p>
<p>There will be pastries from Mindy's but probably not enough for a full meal.</p>


<h4 id="party-logistics">Party logistics</h4>

<p><strong> How should I get there?</strong> </p>
<p>Discounted/free lyft codes to and from Mariscos San Pedro will be provided, and I would highly encourage people not to drive to or from the restaurant. There is extremely limited street parking near Mariscos San Pedro and no convenient public transportation from Hyde Park to Mariscos San Pedro.</p>

<p><strong>What is the dress code?</strong></p>
<p>SABSing on the G train. Logan Square farmers market. Performative male.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of food will be served?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a buffet-style dinner and an open bar with wine, beer, cocktails, and NA drinks. There will not be any pork or shellfish on the menu, and there will be vegetarian options. All allergies and food restrictions can and will be accomodated. Write your dietary needs in your RSVP (or let Abby know), and if your allergies are particularly severe or you are concerned about cross-contamination, let Abby know and she will inquire further about accomodations.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the after party?</strong></p>
<p>Punch house is downstairs.</p>

<p><strong>Can I bring a plus one or a friend?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. I am open to hearing case-by-case appeals, but in general no. You are invited if and only if your name is on the invite list.</p>

<p><strong>Should I get you a gift?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. In fact I am moving out of Chicago so I will be upset if you burden me with anything.</p>
