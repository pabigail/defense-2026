  <h1> Save the Date for Abby's Defense </h1>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, March 26, 2026</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago </p>
  <p><strong>Defense:</strong> During the day in Hyde Park </p>
  <p><strong>Party:</strong> During the evening (~7-10pm) with dinner and drinks </p>


<h3> FAQ: </h2>
<p><strong> What is a defense? </strong> </p>
<p>I am in a PhD program, where I have been doing research. In order to actually receive a PhD, I have to "defend" my research to a committee of professors. The defense will be a ~45 min scientific talk open to the public followed by a closed door committee meeting. You are welcome to attend the public talk. </p>

<p><strong> What kind of research do you do again? </strong> </p>
<p> I work on developing and implementing for modeling materials on the levels of electrons and nuclei. I try to make computational simulations of these materials less expensive and more accurate. </strong> </p>

<p><strong> Will I understand the talk if I don't have a PhD in quantum physics? </strong> </p>
<p> Probably not. It is a talk that is open to the general public but not aimed at the general public. That being said, I would love for you to come if you are interested! And there will be pastries and coffee. </p>

<p><strong> I am actually interested in your research and want to learn more before coming to the defense. Where can I learn more? </strong> </p>
<p> Look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rAFmacAAAAAJ"> google scholar</a> and sort by "year", and my defense will cover the recent works (2025+).</p>

<p><strong> Is it rude to come to the party and not the defense? I have to work/it is inconvenient for me to come to Hyde Park during the day/I think the defense will be boring. </strong> </p>
<p> Not at all! I will in no way be offended if you would just like to come to the party. I am so fortunate to have had a great experience in graduate school, and I am excited to celebrate with my friends, family, and colleagues. In terms of RSVP, it is much more important to decide whether you'd like to come to the party at night than if you'd like to show up to the defense during the day. </p>
