<h3> FAQ </h2>
<p><strong> What is a defense? </strong> </p>
<p>I am in a PhD program, where I have been doing research. In order to actually receive a PhD, I have to "defend" my research to a committee of professors. The defense will be a ~45 min scientific talk open to the public followed by a closed door committee meeting. You are welcome to attend the public talk. </p>
